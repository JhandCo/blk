This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces.[1] The research and development aspect of his blood storage work is disputed.[2] As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned his position with American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950.[3]","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Portrait_of_Charles_Drew.jpg/220px-Portrait_of_Charles_Drew.jpg","[{""facts"":""Charles Richard Drew""},{""facts"":""(1904-06-03)June 3, 1904\n\nWashington, D.C., U.S.""},{""facts"":""April 1, 1950(1950-04-01) (aged 45)\n\nBurlington, North Carolina, U.S.""},{""facts"":""American""},{""facts"":""Amherst College, McGill University, Columbia University""},{""facts"":""Blood banking, blood transfusions""},{""facts"":""Spingarn Medal""},{""facts"":""Scientific career""},{""facts"":""General surgery""},{""facts"":""Institutions""},{""facts"":""Freedman's Hospital\n\nMorgan State University\n\nMontreal General Hospital\n\nHoward University""},{""facts"":""Doctoral advisor""},{""facts"":""John Beattie""},{""facts"":""""}]"
